Web Application Front End based on the endpoints created in assignment 1 and 2.

## Spec
The application should consist of the following logical sections:

- 🏠 Home --> This section is the landing place containing an introduction to the institute. Think of something attractive (cheeky ones are okay) to say about the institute. In fact, if you think you have a really good introduction, post this on Piazza, and the best one (or ones) would attract a certificate of appreciation from the Institute.
- 📰 Staff --> This is section contains a list of staff members of the institute.
- 🛒 Institute Shop --> This section contains the products available in the shop. The display list could grow large, so you will need to have a search bar to dynamically shrink the list. There is an endpoint to support this.
- 👩 User Registration --> This section allows a user to register by choosing a username and password, and providing an address.
- 📖 Guest Book --> This is where guest comments can be entered into. It also shows recent comments from other guests.
